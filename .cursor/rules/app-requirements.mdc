# Node Starter App Requirements

## Core Requirements
- SHOULD live in a single file with minimal dependencies, i.e. `app.py`
- SHOULD uses Python
- SHOULD use the latest version of the official Deepgram SDK
- MUST run in a terminal
- MUST be usable in command line with a single command
- MUST Run with `python app.py`
- MUST get API keys and other sensitive config from a ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE set in terminal
- MUST provide help code comments explaining the primary functions of the app
- MUST be able to use the Deepgram Voice Agent API

## App Requirements:
- MUST launch a web server that can act as a basic proxy to the agent
- MUST allow a browser client to open an http file that is an empty web page
- MUST allow the user to connect their microphone in the browser
- MUST allow the user user to speak via their microphone in the browser
- MUST not have any UI elements
- MUST have the terminal display the interactions with agent
- MUST Listen for the API output and prints it in the terminal
- MUST Listen for the API response messages and print it in the terminal
- MUST Gracefully closes the connection with the agent
- MUST exit gracefully without any Agent API errors
- MUST Runs in terminal to connect to the Agent API, and follows a predefined script of interactions.


## Exampla App Code:

```python

    DeepgramClient,
    DeepgramClientOptions,
    AgentWebSocketEvents,
    SettingsOptions,

    FunctionCallResponse,

# Add debug prints for imports
print("Checking imports...")

## Test Requirements
- MUST have basic tests that validates the browser and agent functionality is working

  Voice Agent Server
    ✓ should start the server successfully
    ✓ should establish WebSocket connection
    ✓ should create Deepgram agent when WebSocket connects
    ✓ should handle audio data from client
